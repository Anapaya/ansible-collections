**status** | **int** | The HTTP status code generated by the origin server for this occurrence of the problem. |

## Example

```python
from ansible.module_utils.appliance_api_client.models.config_put400_response import ConfigPut400Response

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of ConfigPut400Response from a JSON string
config_put400_response_instance = ConfigPut400Response.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print ConfigPut400Response.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
config_put400_response_dict = config_put400_response_instance.to_dict()
